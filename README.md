# 🚘 EV Battery Health Monitoring & Anomaly Detection

## 📖 Project Overview
This project simulates electric vehicle (EV) telemetry data and applies machine learning models to predict battery health and detect operational anomalies. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and dashboard visualizations.

---

## 📊 Features
- EV telemetry data simulation (voltage, current, temperature, etc.)
- Data export as `ev_telemetry_data.csv`
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Random Forest model for battery health prediction
- Isolation Forest model for anomaly detection
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring (optional)
- Notebook-friendly version for simulation without Streamlit

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Streamlit (for dashboard)

---

## 📦 How to Run

### In Jupyter Notebook
1. Open the notebook file.
2. Run all cells sequentially.
3. Visualizations and predictions appear directly in the notebook.

### With Streamlit (Optional)
1. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. Run the dashboard:
    ```
    streamlit run ev_monitoring_dashboard.py
    ```
